part one: downloads
download and install putty(windows)
https://www.putty.org
download rufus and install
https://rufus.ie
download raspbian full buster and recommended software (.zip)
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
extract the contents in the .zip this will be your [image file].
take a micro sd card, and use a dock or a microsd to usb device and plug it into your computer
format your sd card


part two: install raspbian using rufus
run rufus
select your sd card in the first field
select the raspbian image file for the .iso/.img
select start and wait for it to finish.


part three: plugging in the pi
after thats done pull out the sd card, put it into the sd card slot on the pi, its on the "bottom"
plug in the HDMI cord to the pi first, than a keyboard and mouse, and last power cable.
if you plug in power first it might not register your monitor/tv.


part four: setting up your account
log into pi !do the first run setup! do not skip it! select U.S.A english keyboard or you will not find your @ symbol later... if you don't your @ symbol is where your " is.
log into your wifi on pi
do not update yet. I have a reason.
hit the "windows keyboard key" and go to prefferences, go to pi configuration.
go to the interfaces tab.
enable VNC.... and everything else
don't reboot.


part five: setting up your pi as headless(the best thing ever)
look at the top right of your screen. you will see the black and blue VNC logo.
open that.
hit sign in, make and account. add the pi.
on your desktop/laptop open browser search on google VNC viewer download install.
log into your account.
check your email for the log in and authorize yourself.
connect to your pi (type in the pi password at the second login menu)
if it works turn off your pi.
unplug your pi and everything.
put the pi in a corner in your room and run only the power cable to it.
you can connect to the pi using VNC viewer.
you now have a "headless" pi. you can also SSH to it.(see SSH info in the cool stuff section)



part six: installing all the core tools for developing on a pi
using SSH or VNC(or if you decided to not be cool and set it up headless) do the following.
open terminal
(this next part may take a while....)
run these commands one at a time after each one is FINISHED.
sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
installing ffmpeg{
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg



part seven: installing the adafruit webIDE
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Adafruit-WebIDE/master/scripts/install.sh | sudo sh
open a browser on your main desktop.
point your browser URL to "http://***.*.*.***:8080"
replace the "*" with your Pi's local IP address.
make a username and pass.
you now have the adafruit webIDE setup.



part eight: update node-red and node.js
update-nodejs-and-nodered
the next code will make nodered run on startup just like the adafruit webIDE, this is important if you want to develop on these things.
sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
restart the Pi



part nine: installing arduino IDE
you can do it via command line but.... it wont be the full version.. meaning you can't use the library import/search tool, to install the full version you need to go to the arduino
website and download the version for your pi model.
it will be the ARM32bit for the pi3, get the stable release.
open terminal.(replace the *'s with the release info) run these commands.
cd Downloads/
tar -xf arduino-1.*.*-linuxarm.tar.xz
sudo mv arduino-1.*.* /opt
sudo /opt/arduino-1.*.*/install.sh

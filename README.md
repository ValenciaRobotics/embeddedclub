# WhoIsHome
Valencia Tech Clubs embedded systems divisions github

the Who Is home project does the following:

runs a python script that checks for the mac addresses of devices connected to your network.
  it runs those addresses against a list of addresses and if the address listed is present it sends a char to an arduino by using serial communications. 
 
 the arduino controls a LED strip and when it recieves a char it has an associated color for that device and it lights the LEDs for that person based on them being present.
